Solving the merge conflict was the most straightforward part of this project for me. After spending a little time figuring out how to create an SSH key to be able to upload my original project to the github it was mostly smooth sailing. The merge conflict was extremely easy for me to solve as it was just 2 comments in the same spot so I didnâ€™t have to figure out how to change things and or add the two commits together without breaking them both. I simply went into atom and changed the 2 comments to a single comment that combined them both. Then I simply pushed the files and was able to merge the two branches. I had to use github documentation for help both with creating the SSH key https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account and another page on github docs to help with github commands for solving and merging the two branches. https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line Both recourses were extremely helpful and relatively easy to follow.
